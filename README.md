# Debugging App

This app represents a REST API for a book management system. The master branch contains all of the tests for the application, but there is no implementation code yet! The models and API exist, but they need implementing to pass all of the tests.

Once you've got all of the tests passing, you have the following extension tasks:

- Can you spot any holes in the testing? If you could add more tests for the existing feature set, what would you test? Create these tests and make PRs for them.
- If you could add one feature to the resulting app, what would it be?
- The tests don't currently run a full Jakarta EE container. What are the downfalls of this? How might you test database connections, or other Java EE functionalities?

Don't be afraid to ask for help, and good luck!
